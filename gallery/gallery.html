      <h2>1. Macaw Bird</h2>
      <img src="media/macawedit.jpg" width="500" />
      <p>
        This is a Macaw on a tree branch. It has red, blue, and green fur. It has a sharp white beak too.<br />
        I took this photo when I went to Ancol, Indonesia. <br />
        There were many birds at there. Macaw bird is one of my favourites.
        <br />If you want to go there, you must bring your camera because it's very beautiful.<br />

      <h2>2. Lotus Flower</h2>
      <img src="media/Lotus.jpg" width="500" />
      <p>
        This is a blooming Lotus Flower that has a bright pink color. There is a bee that want it's nectar. <br />
        I took this at Kebun Raya Bogor, Indonesia. I saw many things at there and I took photo all of it. <br />
        That place was clean and the air was fresh, so we can enjoy the beautiful scenery.

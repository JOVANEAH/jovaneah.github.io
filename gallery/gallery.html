      I took this photo when I went to Ancol, Indonesia. <br />
      There were many birds at there. Macaw bird is one of my favourites. It had blue, red, and green fur. It had a sharp white beak too. <br />
      Such a beautiful bird.<br />
      I <br />If you want to go there, you must bring your camera because it's very beautiful.<br />
